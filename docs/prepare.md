# Prepare

Find unique details and needs for the application being migrated, define re-architecture needs and required code and database changes to ensure the application will work as expected once migrated.

## Architect Design Review

We recommend that an Architecture review is conducted at the beginning of each App migration (during **Prepare** phase) and again just before **Production Deploy**. Engage a FastTrack for Azure Engineer to perform the review. The engineer will follow the review process described in [FastTrack for Azure Architectural / Solution Review and Guidance Framework].

> ðŸ“– See also **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework]**

> ðŸ’¡ You can perform a well-architected assessment at any time by using the **[Well-Architected Review tool]**.


## App Service Migration Assessment

Use the **[App Service Migration Assistant]** or a third party tool to scan and generate a report on the current state of the Web App. 

## Data Migration Assessment

Use the **[Database Migration Assistant]** to evaluate the Databases for migration.

## Other prepare steps

* Define Migration Strategy
* Identify Required Changes
