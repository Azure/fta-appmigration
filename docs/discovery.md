# Discovery

Almost any web app can be migrated to Azure PaaS given enough time and effort. This checklist can be used to assess an App in the early stages of a migration project. It is a list of common technical scoping questions that an engineer may ask.

## Current state

What is currently deployed and where? What are the dependencies?

> ðŸ’¡ **[Azure Migration Center]** offers resources, tools and programmes for evaluating and performing Web App Migrations. 

#### Environments

1. On-prem | Another Cloud | Azure VMs?
1. Which region / geographic area?
1. How many environments? e.g. Dev/Test, UAT, Prod

#### Web tier

1. What versions .NET Framework? 
1. Any classic ASP?
1. More than one Web VM node?
1. Load balancer?
1. How many VMs, cores. How much RAM per VM?
1. How many apps / websites in total?
1. VMs have single role or are shared with SQL/WCF/Windows Services/Other?

#### WCF services

1. WCF services used? 
1. Same VM (tier) as Web or separate?
1. Any non HTTP bindings?

#### DB tier

1. What version SQL Server?
1. How many VMs, cores. How much RAM per VM?
1. How many DBs and what size?
1. SQL Server using local Timezone or UTC?
1. SSRS? SSAS? SSIS?

#### Networking & Security

1. Are websites private (internal / intranet) or public?
1. DMZ?
1. WAF? Audit or Block?
1. Connectivity to on-prem services?
1. Firewall?
1. DDOS?

#### IAM

1. How are users Authenticated? (Any AD depends?)
1. How are users Authorized?

#### SMTP

1. IIS SMTP?
1. SQL Sendmail?
1. Private SMTP Gateway?
1. Port 25 open for outbound?

## Compatibility Checks

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, some refactoring and/or rearchitecting may be required to make the solution compatible with Azure App Services.

#### Web

1. Any MSI installed components? Or, bundled software e.g. local MySQL etc.
1. Any GAC'ed DLLs?
1. Event store or registry access requirements?
1. Win32 API depends?
1. Any COM or COM+ components?
1. Any binary references?
1. Only ports 80 and 443 used?
1. Any machine or IIS web config depends that that cannot be website-web.config overidden?
1. Any current SMB / network storage depends?
1. If there's an existing monitoring solution, is it compatible?

#### DB

1. Any GO statements in SQL?
1. Any cross-DB joins in SQL?
1. Any .NET CLR Functions in SQL?
1. Any SQL MSDTC?
1. Any FILESTREAM?

## Business requirements

What are the current vs. target business (non-functional) requirements? 

### Performance

1. Concurrent and total users?
1. How many App Plans needed, proposed density (beware too many apps on a plan, and apps with different usage characteristics) 
1. Peak requests per minute/second (RPM/RPS)?
1. Current CPU and RAM utilization on VMs at peak load? (do these match current VM requirements - think high memory)
1. Scale out: Is there High memory utilisation, typically this wont be solved by scale-out
1. Current SQL VM IOPS at peak load?
1. Any direct storage dependencies, e.g. CRM code r/w to d:\home or log files? (App Service d:/home is a network share not disk)
1. Is there code doing task offloading in context or multi-threading - concurrent tasks?
 
### Reliability

1. Recovery time objecttive (RTO)? 
1. Consider >1 instances. 
1. App Service isnt (at this time) zone aware. Note: ASE is, but only if you deploy an ASE per zone (costly).
1. Recovery point objective (RPO)? 
1. System uptime (as percentage), e.g. [99.9%]

## Target State

#### App Services

1. App Service Plan or App Service Environment?
1. Private endpoints/vnet integration (or not)
1. DevOps considerations?
1. Cost constraints?

#### Azure SQL

1. Azure SQL DB?
   1. vCore or DTU model?
   1. Elastic Pool?
1. Azure SQL MI?Generally
